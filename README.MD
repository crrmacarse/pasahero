# Pasahero App

An interactive commuter app for Ilonggos by an Ilonggo. This aims to support LPTRP implementation of Iloilo and encourage
the masses to utilize public transportation. Lets prevent Iloilo becoming a car-centric city today!

> Inspired by SakayPH(https://sakay.ph) and Commute Davao(https://commutedavao.com)

## MVP

- Interactive Commuter map of Iloilo
- Detailed description of each route
- Before year end of 2023

## Long term

- Nation wide support
- Editable route
- Integration with drivers, making them visible on map with their location(Make this route-subscribable to lessen load
of servers)
- Designated loading and unloading points
- Optional subscription service to support growth
- Partnership with Government and Transport groups
